## Early earthquake detection through mobile device
This android app takes the accelerometer data of the deveice and detects wheteher an earthquake is going on or not. A firebase backend has been used. With the help of that the number of earthquake occurance is calculated. If we get a certain number of detection in a certain area, then we notify all the devices around that area.
